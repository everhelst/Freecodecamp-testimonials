This repository contains a clone of freecodecamp.org's testimonials section. It's a simple project, but it means a lot to me, because here I used a reusable REACT component for the first time. Thanks to this project I was able to understand the advantages of using components in front-end development.


For this project I use my knowledge of HTML. CSS, Bootstrap, Javascripty and React.
